### how to use it ‚ú®

- use this template in a new project (on github, a green button on the top right)
- search for 'CHANGE' and make the necessary adjustments
- done c:

### runing locally üå∫

this project is configured to use dynamic linking for debug builds and fast recompiling by default.
in order to have the fastest compile, you may install [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold) and use rust nightly (`rustup default nightly`).
if you don't want some of these features, go to [.cargo/config](.cargo/config) and follow the instructions, or remove it to disable optimizations all together.

to run a debug build use cargo:

```sh
cargo run
```

you can also play around with some of the included examples with `cargo run --example <name>`. and if you want to get started quickly, copy any example to `src/main.rs`!

if you have nix installed, running `nix develop` you get a shell with all the dependencies already installed.

### release üåª

in order to create a release build with binaries for all platforms you have two options: either you trigger it manually on the actions page or you add a tag like '[anything]0.1' with the version you want.

```sh
git tag -a "0.1" -m "test release"
git push --tags
```

if you want to also deploy this build to itch, go to the repository settings > secrets > actions and add:

```
ITCH_API_KEY = [your api key]
```

to run a release build locally:

```sh
cargo run --release --no-default-features --features release
```

if the `tts` feature is enabled, you may need to install [speech dispatcher](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Speech_dispatcher) on linux.

### profiling üìà

bevy has built in support for the [tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) profiler. you can profile your game easily:

```sh
tracy-capture -o capture.tracy &
cargo run --release --no-default-features --features trace
```

and then view the result with:

```sh
tracy capture.tracy
```

### other projects üíñ

this is heavily based on [NiklasEi/bevy_game_template](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_game_template) and [bevyengine/bevy_github_ci_template](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy_github_ci_template). please use those for more general templates that are more robust and have community support. hello bevy is hardly tested and very tailored to my preferences.

### plugins ü™¥

this template intends to use as little external dependencies as possible to facilitate version updates and avoid bloat. that said, there are a few awesome community plugins that make everything as easy as possible. all of these are optional and the template will work without them, you can disable them using feature flags.

- [leafwing-input-manager](https://github.com/Leafwing-Studios/leafwing-input-manager): an awesome way of handling input from multiple sources and create simple bindings
- [bevy-alt-ui-navigation-lite](https://github.com/bevy-alt-ui-navigation-lite): allows to easily make uis that can be navigable by mouse, keyboard or gamepad
- [sickle_ui](https://github.com/UmbraLuminosa/sickle_ui): helpers on top of bevy's native ui that makes it much easier to work with
- [bevy-persistent](https://github.com/umut-sahin/bevy-persistent): automatically read and write game data to disk
- [bevy_embedded_assets](https://github.com/vleue/bevy_embedded_assets): only on release by default, allows placing assets inside of the binary for ease of distribution
